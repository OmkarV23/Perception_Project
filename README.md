# Perception_Project

## :ear: + :eyes: using :hugs:

Added SRGAN script to rescale image 4X. Haven't added the bounding box scaling logic yet. Add it, I am working.
If facing any issue, feel free to ask me.

Download weights darknet53 from weights/download_weights.sh
comment yolov3 and yolov3-tiny weights before downloading, if not commented.

I have not added wave2vec2.0 weight file yet. It's too heavy to upload. Fu#king 1.5gb. I will upload drive link shortly.

Added custom torchsummary to include custom :hugs: modules.

Run single pass as:

`python3 python3 train.py --data /workspace/omkar_projects/PyTorch-YOLOv3/config/custom.data --pretrained_weights ../weights/darknet53.conv.74`
